# merge_heap
this is for a school project I am choosing c for extra fun points

fast_length_sort.c is really the only useful thing this code would ever do but it is a pretty neat trick. 
I think this may be close to optimal in terms of how much memory I am alocating.
if we have a better delimeter this may actually be useful for stuff like bucketing text for LLMs

other than that fairly unreamarkble
