# merge_heap

This repository houses my school project, I have chosen in C for extra fun points.

fast_length_sort.c is really the only useful thing this code would ever do but it is a pretty neat trick. 
I think this may be close to optimal in terms of how much memory I am allocating.
if we have a better delimiter this may actually be useful for stuff like bucketing text for LLMs

other than that fairly unremarkable 


### CLI and Heap Implementation

`cli.c` serves as the required command-line interface (CLI) for the school assignment, facilitating interaction with the core functionality.

`heap.h` encompasses the full implementations of all algorithms specified in the assignment, complete with analysis and optimizations.

Beyond these elements, the project is fairly straightforward.
